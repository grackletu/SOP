Aliquots of the solution, containing nanogram amounts of U will be added to PFA vials containing geologic material and a mixture of HNO3 (± HF) for mineral digestion. After sample digestion and a series of drydown-reflux procedures, U and Th isotopes will be separated by ion chromatography, dried just to dryness and shipped in sealed vials to a collaborating laboratory for isotopic analysis.
